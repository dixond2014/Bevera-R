This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 
Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. What you are running will be needed for visualizing your data from the Indian Covid Zones.  

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(gapminder)
library(tidyr)
library(readr)
library(openintro)
options(scipen=999,digits=3)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*. Here, we are going to upload the data that we are going to visualize and look at how the data looks. 
```{r}
df <- read.csv("covid_zones.csv")
glimpse(df)
```
We now want to look at the distribtion of zones among the states. To do so we first look at the contingency table.
```{r}
table(df$Zone,df$State)
```
We have below the code for the bar graph taking into consideration the count of all of the State's zoning stacked on each other.

```{r}
ggplot(df,aes(x=Zone,fill=State)) + geom_bar()

```
To unstackc the information, we can simply use:
```{r}
ggplot(df,aes(x=Zone,fill=State)) + geom_bar(position="dodge")
```

We now want to look at the zones as a proportion and not as a count, so we use:
```{r}
ggplot(df,aes(x=Zone,fill=State)) + geom_bar(position="fill") + ylab("proportion")
```


Which gives the 100% stacked plot conditioned on State. If we want to see the same conditioned on Zone, we use:
```{r}
ggplot(df,aes(x=State,fill=Zone)) + geom_bar(position="fill") + ylab("proportion") + scale_fill_manual(values = c("Green", "Orange", "Red"))
```

For readability on for the x-axis, use:
```{r}
ggplot(df,aes(x=State,fill=Zone)) + geom_bar(position="fill") + ylab("proportion")+ scale_fill_manual(values = c("Green", "Orange", "Red")) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90))
```
This is just a general view of the total in each zone in India.

```{r}
ggplot(df,aes(x=Zone)) + geom_bar()

```

If concerned with analyzing one variableâ€™s distribution against only one value of another variable.

```{r}
ggplot(df,aes(x=Zone)) + geom_bar() + facet_wrap(~State)+ theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90)) + scale_fill_manual(values = c("Green", "Orange", "Red"))
```




When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
